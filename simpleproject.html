    <h3>JAVASCRIPT CLASS ASSIGNMENT</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
        The sun dipped low behind the horizon, casting a golden glow over the quiet countryside. The air was filled with the soft rustle of leaves as a gentle breeze moved through the trees. In the distance, a small stream trickled over smooth stones, its sound mingling with the faint calls of birds settling in for the night. The sky above shifted from bright orange to deep purple, scattered with the first twinkling stars. It was a peaceful moment, the kind that made the world seem slower, as if time itself had paused to savor the beauty of the fading day.
